# conversation-service-functions


## what is this project?
this is a cli tool that will allow you to write simple application for the Vonage conversation api https://developer.nexmo.com/conversation in your local env with minimal configuration.







## install prerequisites


### nexmo credentials
To make this app running, you need 
 - a nexmo api key, api secret : https://dashboard.nexmo.com
 - a nexmo phone number (also known as LVN, Long Virtual Number) : https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers

### install node 14+
suggested way to install node is via nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/pulls). so: 

```  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash  ```

then run: 

``` nvm install 14 ```

# install

```npm install -g conversation-api-function ```

## first time config

the first time you run this, you need to have your api-key, api-secret and an lvn (look the prerequisites section above):

```conversation-api-function config-new -a <api-key> -s <api-secret> -l <lvn>```

if you struggle with this, run: 
```conversation-api-function config-new -h```

## create a new conversation function

``` conversation-api-function new my_capi_fn ```

## run it

``` conversation-api-function run my_capi_fn ```

now call you lvn, you should hear an "hello world" mesage


open the following file ``` my_capi_fn/index.js ``` for more info


## further docs:
check the internal conversations api here: https://jurgob.github.io/conversation-service-docs/#/openapiui
and the possible events here: https://jurgob.github.io/conversation-service-docs/#/custom



## some tricks
This project use a logging library called `bunyan` whitch is producing json logs.
if you install bunyan ( ```npm install -g bunyan ``` ) then you can run: 
`conversation-api-function run my_capi_fn | bunyan`. you will now see a formatted log. 

p.s. bunyan is producing standard json, so you can also use standard unix tools like jq to format the logs: `tail -f vapi_hello_world.log | jq`

## Examples

Once you have configured conversation-api-functions, you can run every project without configuring this tools again. 
Here are some examples you can run just coloning it and executing it with the following commans: 

downloding / installing the repo:
```
git clone <GIT_REPO> <MY_DIR>
cd <MY_DIR>
nvm use
npm install
```
then run it with: 

```  conversation-api-function run <MY_DIR>```


e.g: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jurgob/phone_inbound_asr my_capi_fn
cd my_capi_fn
nvm use
npm install
conversation-api-function run .

```

  git_repo: https://github.com/jurgob/capi-fn-pstn-call-authentication

  description: someone is calling your nexmo number (LVN), he will be asked to say his/her name, The agent on the browser will se the incomming call and the name of the caller.

- **Record a leg or a conversation**

  git_repo (example 1, record by leg): https://github.com/jurgob/capi-fn_record_leg
  
  git_repo (example 2, record by conversation): https://github.com/JohnPeters7116/capi-fn_record_conversation

  
  description: the call in conversations follow the MCU model (https://bloggeek.me/webrtc-multiparty-video-alternatives/).  In a nutshell, there's a mixer (in our case the conversations) where every leg (aka every call partecipant) are mixed togheter. 
If you want to record the call from a leg point of view, that's the example 1 is gonna show how to do it. if you are interested in record all the leg, then check the example 2. 
question: what 's the difference between recording a leg or a converstion?. Immagine leg a is earmuffing leg b. in the leg recording, you will not have the record of the leg b, while in the conversaion record you will have both the legs in the recoring


   
  

## Use a Real Redis

by default the storage client is saving your data in-memory, so every time you restart you loose al your data. 
To use a real redis server instead, you just need to set the env var CONV_API_FUNC_REDIS_URL.
See the example below for more details

### use a docker redis for local deployment

be sure you have installed docker
to install redis in your local host, you just need to run: 
```docker run --name capifn-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis```


now open your config runnig ```conversation-api-function config```
this is gonna open an editor with your configs. Add this line: 
``` 
CONV_API_FUNC_REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```
 



## deploy in production

### create deployment credentials
0) from the project directory, run the following command: 
```conversation-api-function run .  ```

this is gonna create a `.env.prod` file with the credential to go live

### deploy in heroku. 
1) after you have created a deployment credentials, for the first thing you need to init your project on git: 
```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m 'first commit'

```

2) be sure you have an heroku account:  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

3) insatall the heroku cli with ```npm install -g heroku```

4) then you can create an heroku app :

```
heroku login
heroku apps:create my_capi_heroku_app
```

5) now you can finally push the app live.
```
git push heroku main
```

if you look the app logs with ```heroku logs``` you will see that's the app is failing. that's becouse you need to configure the env vars. An easy way is the following: 

```
cat .env.prod | grep -v PRIVATE_KEY | xargs heroku config:set

# set private key
PRIVATE_KEY="`cat .env.prod | grep PRIVATE_KEY | cut -c 27-`"
echo -e $PRIVATE_KEY > private.key
heroku config:set CONV_API_FUNC_PRIVATE_KEY="$PRIVATE_KEY"

# set webhook url
heroku config:set CONV_API_FUNC_SERVER_URL="https://my_capi_heroku_app.herokuapp.com"
```

6) now go to `https://my_capi_heroku_app.herokuapp.com/hello` to check is working
